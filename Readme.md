since i wrote it to not forget DataFrames in python :D .. Here we are..

BooksFiltering.py -- consists of a Simple class that is very flexible to handle more methods for faster results.

Notes:
    -   it's just a sample , so to make it usable for you , you have to change the algorithm path  ..
    -   Books dir, is uploaded with it ,to make it clear of how it works..
